An iPhone application for sending accelerometer data from your iPhone/iPod touch to your development computer for using accelerometer inside the iPhone simulator. Let's you develop and debug applications that require accelerometer without running the application on the device.

Can also be used to create desktop applications utilizing the iPhone accelerometer as control.

Uses UDP broadcast/unicast for sending data, so you can even have multiple senders/receivers at the same time.
